Although known as ‘the house of bread [or 'food']', here is a terrible and ironic reversal for this family as Bethlehem becomes a place of scarcity.\n\nMore reversals follow. Their initial security in Moab is upended by the death of Naomi’s husband and two sons. Both Naomi and her daughters-in-law Ruth and Orpah are widows, left childless after the passing of their husbands. With no explanation for the death of the men, the book of Ruth, like Elwell’s The Wedding Dress, leaves the audience to fill in the gaps.\n\nYet, though this chapter opens with famine and despair, the narrator anticipates a hopeful change to their situation as Naomi and Ruth return to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest (Ruth 1:22).",
